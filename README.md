## Conway's Game of Life â€“ Rules

> Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where each cell lives, dies, or is born based on simple rules involving its 8 neighbors.

- Three Rules

1. **Survival**
    - A **live** cell with **2 or 3 live neighbors** stays **alive**.

2. **Death**
    - A **live** cell with **fewer than 2** or **more than 3** live neighbors **dies**  
      _(from loneliness or overcrowding)_.

3. **Birth**
    - A **dead** cell with **exactly 3 live neighbors** becomes **alive**.

> These rules are applied to every cell **simultaneously** in each new generation.
> Simple rules. Complex patterns. Infinite possibilities.
